        "When dealing with high-dimensional data (especially real-valued data), one of the first things we will typically study is the covariance matrix, $C$.  This matrix descibes all of the pairwise linear correlations between the $d$ different variables that are simultaneously measured.  While this matrix has many limitations in terms of its ability to characterize the high-dimensional data (see question below), there is often much to be learned - and it's easy to calculate! - so it's usually a great place to orient one's self when staring at a new dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be more precise, the covariance matrix is the collection of all linear covariances between each pair of variables.  Mathematically, if $X\\in\\Re^{N\\times d}$ ($N$ is the number of data points, $d$ is the dimensionality of the data), then we define the covariance matrix, C, via:\n",

        "While each of the entries in the matrix can be positive (positively correlated), negative (negatively correlatied), or zero (uncorrelated), the covariance matrix is symmetric (switching $i$ and $j$ in the definition of $C_{ij}$ above results in the same result, so $C_{ij} = C_{ji}$).  Symmetric matrices have many convenient [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix), including the fact that all of its eigenvalues must be greater than zero.

        "Answer: For a matrix with random entries, I would expect values that are not only close to 0's. For example, creating a random matrix with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 3 would give me a wide range of values such as -4.2, 1.6, and 8.1. In contrast, the eigenvalues are all close to the variance of that matrix and the eigenvectors all range around 0. </font>"

In this section, we will investigate aspects of this problem, but we will return to this topic (in a more formal manner) later in the course."

        "Answer: Out of the three eigenvalues, 8.72 could be considered as significant. When creating a covariance matrix and computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors during principal component analysis of high-dimensional data, it is critical to retain as much information as possible while successfully reducing the dimentionality. This is done by capturing the maximum amount of variance. After sorting the three eigenvalues in descending order, the first component accounts for the largest variance, which is 8.72 in our case.   </font>\n"
